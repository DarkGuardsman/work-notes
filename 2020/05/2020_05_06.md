## SSL research for job

HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP

S -> Secure

Stands for HTTP over Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

HTTPS means all communication is encyrpted

SSL certificate builds trust between a browser and server

This cert is the server's verified ID

Process works by sending the server's public key to the browser. The browser then verifies the key/cert is correct using a CA centeral authority. The browser then creats a shared key and sends a copy of his key to the server using the server's public key. The server then decodes the message using it's private key and sends all future messages using the shared key.

any message created with a public key can only be decrypted using a private key

anyone with access to a public key can verify that the message could only have been created by a private key

CA's public key is used to verify the cert sent by a server is trusted by the CA.

CA - certificate authority

CA is used to ensure a cert can be trusted.

A public and private key pair needs to be created. 

A person sends a certificate signing request to a known authory to sign a cert using this key pair. The CA then signs the request with it's private key to verify that the cert is signed using the public key.

self-signed certificate - create your own CA to sign your own keys. Process is about the same as normal CA process. It has the draw back that a user has to trust the key.

Javascript can be obfuscated easily 

React Native is setup to force HTTPS

![NGINX](images/2020_05_06_NGINX.png)

Seems we can do all the work from NGINX itself and don't need to mess with node.js side.

They use certbot to create and verify a cert.

```

Looks like we use the same proxy settings as normal. We just move them into the second block.

can also add `server_name testserver.io` to both

Somewhat useful to watch but didn't contain any new info. He automated a lot of the steps so didn't gain what I needed.

Shows a docker compose, so is more useful

Annoying intro music

image -> application

container -> running instance

random idea I was remined of while watching this. For mrSmith app we should use docker images preloaded with software and tests to run against a mod. Can have an image with a basic modpack and a series of tests.

Was not a useful video

Has a very simple example of a compose with a proxy

docker runs a DNS inside the compose to tell each container where other containers are by name.

can setup a round robin DNS lookup to act as a load balancer. This has a down side as NGINX only loads the configuration once. So if you change the scale while it is running it doesn't know about the change.

This can be fixed by adding a resolver to match the docker's DNS

```
server {

    listen 80;

    resolver 127.0.0.11; //Need to look this up if it changed
    set $upstream http://app
    location / {
        proxy_pass $upstream;
    }
}
```

NGINX can catch things for 5 mins or more. Needs to be set shorter if things are scaling more often.
