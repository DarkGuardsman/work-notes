## Current Thoughts

No clue what will be the focus of today. Likely going to be dealing with caffine (monster energy drinks) withdraw. I do want to try to work on something either with 3D printing or improving my living space. I watched a nice video by 'CGP Grey' on living spaces. 

## CGP Grey - Lockdown Productivity: Spaceship you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3C

He used the idea of each house is a space ship and the goal is to come back from space better then before. A lot of metaphors are used but the idea is to point out good habits to doing well when isolated. Bit late on this video but I find it very useful.

Core goal if I follow this would be to break up my living space into sections. Then dedicate each section to a set goal. This is counter to how I currently exist in which I eat, sleep, relax, create, and work in the same area most days. No joke I often sleep next to my desk for naps. Though At least I attempt to sleep in my bed upstairs. 

So right now I have 3 floors in my condo

* Down stairs - currently my office/lab, half utility room & bathroom
* Mid floor - kitchen and living room
* Upstairs - bedroom and bath/shower

There is not a lot I can do to avoid my office being both relax, work, and creativity all in one. I could sub-divide the room to split creativity from relax. However, I only have 1 computer which is used for all 3 activities. May I should setup a second computer to split off some of the creativity things. 

Another idea would be to move my work area to the midfloor.

## Amazon tools showed up

Basic tool bag with tools and small gram scale.

Tool bag came in an amazon basic box tightly packed. Can tell they mass produce these XD

Tools in the back are also in plain amazon basic boxes with no markings.

Bag feels very cheap, almost like those fallotu 76 bags. Its likely going to fall apart rather fast when it gets used. Luckily I have zero plan to use it much. It likely will be store in a random location and used only as needed.

To be honest, might just use the boxes. They seem rather good at storing these tools.

Tools feel very cheap, are not refined well, and joints are unoiled/stiff. They also smell heavily of machine oil. Likeliy a waste of money and I should have just bought individual tools.

This really reminds me of thost $20 tool sets you buy for kids.

Tape messure has a very solid spring in it but is hard to pull out.

Hammer feels very solid, grips suck and is covered in machine oil.

Screw drivers feel very cheap, one says "chrome vanadium" on it. All tools have "Amazon Basic" logo/name.

Hands actually burn a bit from touching this stuff. Likely need to wash and clean them all.

Bits they included seem to be raw iron or steel with no treatment. They likely are going to rust.

## JWT

This is more for my day job but watching videos on my personal machine

Looks like they are using local storage to store things.

When doing posts they set the header to

https://youtu.be/Nq9RmAB9eag?t=1739

```javascript
{
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer: ${jwt}`
    }
}
```

I think this is the only change I Need to do to my fetch calls. Meaning I likely only need light changes for my work systems.

Looks like a full e2e video on node.js and not what I'm looking for... bookmarking for later.

I like the desing of it, 4 legs and asematric layout. Has an almost drone like visual even though I'm rather sure its 1 to 2 man crew.
