## Plan

No idea

## Shelf Bracket

1am - Queued up a bracket to see if it will print well. I don't like the design but a good test of the printer

Stranging was easy enough to remove with finger nails... not even real pressure just a quick press.

Rrint quality is ok considering no supports and default settings for chiron in cura. Adjusted a little I can get this to be perfect. At the same time a little post processing will fix a majority of these issues.

Still not happy with the design but going to print another to see how well it goes up as a shelf. Big issue with this is its going to be a pain to clean and process in the supports.

1:28pm - Tried to sand it, this worked ok by hand but the belt sander just friction heated it until it melted.

Over all the surface is smoother, but it very much is not even. I'll need to make a jig for this in the future.

Had to drill out the holes for the screw heads to fit.

## Stud finder

Figured out how my stud finger works. You have to prime it first on a space without a stud. Then it will sorta detect studs... it still very much sucks but I got it to work well enough I found a few.

## Modular DVD rack

4:18pm - Neat little rack that uses the DVD case as the shelf itself. Found it while looking for modular shelf prints to try.

## Prints to try later

## Screw messure

![cura screw messure](images/2020_05_23_screwMessure.png)

Chiron is not setup for the details so it failed to come out in a way to work.

![screw messure print time](images/2020_05_23_22.00.15.jpg)

![screw messure printed](images/2020_05_23_21.51.19.jpg)

![screw messure printed 2](images/2020_05_23_21.51.51.jpg)

Can see it over sized on the print... thinking about it i'm using the chiron settings from the latest cura. I might have forgotten to update that its a .8mm instead of a .2mm head. Will have to check this later as I plan to do the MMD instead.

Going to retry on the mini-delta

![MMD screw messure 3](images/2020_05_24_00.57.40.jpg)

![MMD screw messure 4](images/2020_05_24_00.50.37.jpg)

Quality turned out good minus a defect on layering. I think the start of the print got a filment thread under it from calibration phase in the MMD printer.

![MMD screw messure painted](images/2020_05_24_01.02.50.jpg)

Decided to paint the numbers for fun. Likely will reprint later as I think the delaying warped the corner making the M2 slot useless.

Confirmed by laying on a flat surface the part is warped. The corner is raised and curved on the top. The bottom is also a few mm off the table.

comparing the two versions, the mini-delta did a far better job in terms of detail.

Seems the bed is warped on the mini-delta

![warped re-print](images/2020_05_24_01.26.22.jpg)

Made sure it was cleaned and clear before it started. It then warped during first layer. I noticed the part was flat but it never bounded with the layer under it.

![card check](images/2020_05_24_01.28.11.jpg)

Checked with a card, can see the gap under it. Not sure which side is actually warped and not sure how to tell for sure. This gives me a rough idea somthing is wrong.

Might be a g-code issue as well.

Might want to try the glass palte again in the future. As these clips would work wonders.

## Traincraft got nuked

Mostly drama from a while ago but they finally got hit for it. Example of why crash code is stupid and eventually you do get caught for it.

## ICBM work

Worked on the ICBM mod, took me a while to recall what I was doing. Seems I was last working on changing out the redmatter blast logic from a controller to an entity based system.

The previous iteration used an entity as a place holder with all logic in the blast code. The new system will use an entity as the main driver and trigger logic in handlers. This will migrate the redmatter from a blast to an entity. Though I will keep a wrapper to help mod developers understand what the entity actually is and how it works.

Some problems I noticed is we have redmatter specific logic in a lot of locations. The Blass.class for example has logic to handle antimatter destroying redmatters. This needs to be switched an API based system to better allow interaction.

I also need to fix the code to make it easier to unit test. The goal should be to break everthing up into small simple methods. Then to test each method for its inputs and outputs. This way we can ensure the logic matches the expectations.
