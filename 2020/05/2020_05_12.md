## Plan

Nothing, still focusing on self.. though if given time I want to work on a few mods.

## Loot modifiers

https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table

What I need to fix my loot table entry is `minecraft:alternative` condition. This will join conditions together as an `OR` statement

```
alternative - Joins conditions from parameter terms with "or".
        terms: A list of conditions to join using 'or'.
```

## Progressive Cleanup

I should look at updating this https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/progressive-world-cleanup

## Wooden shears

8am - Pushed out release of v1.1.0 https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sbm-wooden-shears/files/2954828

Also updated and created a change log in the README.md . Which should work fine given changes are rare for this mod.

8:34am - Closed issues:

* https://github.com/BuiltBrokenModding/SBM-WoodenShears/issues/10
* https://github.com/BuiltBrokenModding/SBM-WoodenShears/issues/2
