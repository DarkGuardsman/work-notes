## Atomic Science bug

Was reported that atomic science has a ghost inventory bug with the UI. I think this is an old report but I should fix it eventuall.

## ICBM issues

GHXX asked if we could move the alpha to beta. I had to point out that redmatter is still broken.

Tommeh pointed out there are other issues he thinks still exist

> 9:41am - Like 2 redmatters spawning thousands of red matters
Or it's state not saving properly
And the broken redmatter movement config

Not sure these are issues still, with the exception of the config as that might be broken.
