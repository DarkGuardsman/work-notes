## Current Thoughts 3:30pm

Current thoughts is i'm tried and have no idea what I want to do today. I should focus on cleaning up the workshop and looking into updating mods. As I need to come up with a plan B for income if my day job starts to fail. I doubt it will happen as I've proven myself useful. However, there is always the chance the company itself fails more and results in additional layoffs to save money. Regardless of how good I am at my job I can still be layoff if there is no money.

As for the mods I think two big goals stand out. First is doing an audit of all mods I still own. This way I can see what it worth developing and what is worth not developing. After this I need to get back to working on the site. As curse might not last forever and I need to make sure income is secured for mod downloads. This way I can fall back on it as an income source if I lose my day job.

## Current Project

First priority of the day is cleaning and working on storage. Second priority is auditing the mods.

## 3D printed phone stand 3:40pm

Started a print last night before I went to bed at (2am ??). It completed but has a lot of quality issues. Most notably are lines that droop down in what looks like layer failures. I don't have enough experience to know the right technical term. As its not waving and sorta looks like over extrusion.

Either way didn't fit my charger. Which was the whole reason I wanted to print the file. Since my current chargers I print are not the right size.

Which I should have read the description as it was built for https://www.banggood.com/AUDEW-Q5-Universal-Qi-Wireless-Charger-Charging-Pad-Transmitter-p-985122.html

Really this is one of the few items I should just buy. As I think chargers are rather cheap... but I think I paid $50 for this fast one from samsung. It seems to work extremely well.

My previous prints supported this charger https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UCZGS6S

Which works very well at charging but was a little slow for when I left my phone near dead. Reality is I usually leave the phone on the charger all day. So slow doesn't matter all that much. Still would be useful to have a partial stand to make it so I can use the phone as a mini-display on my desk.

Guess I could design a simple stand, the shape is not exactly complex and I think I can map it out for design. Maybe design a simple circle and fill in the slack with screw mounts. Can't completely seal it off as it has a fan for coiling.
