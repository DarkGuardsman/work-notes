## Plan

No plan for today, failed to even act on yesterday's plan at all and am too tired today to try any projects.


## Auto-Hide UI

Useful mod idea from request channel in MMD

I thought of an idea about a cool mod for 1.12 (which could also later be updated to newer versions). Imagine you would have no item slots on the bottom of the screen, no hunger or health bar. Similar to what it's like to F1 mode, but you could still see your hands or weapons/items you're holding. And you could see item slots if you'd switch items (it would temporarily appear on screen for a moment and then disappear again). It would be similar with health (it would show up if you'd get hurt and then dissapear again). You could have a clearer screen that way and it would be more immersive.

Seems this mod is not being maintained much more and there is an interest in a clone. I could dig into it as I need some unique lighting for my mods.

## Gamerules as configs

Had a talk in MMD design channel about using game rules as configs.

Idea would be for handling runtime level settings of mods. Mostly targetted at short term per world settings.

Upcraft brought up a good point of using datapacks to switch settings on the fly. Allowing servers to setup ways of doing per world settings for a mod. Then switching setting packages quickly.

## multi-filment video

Good review video on the process.... still too expensive to buy. However, I noticed he was using https://canvas3d.io/ in the background which is a product of https://www.mosaicmfg.com/products/canvas seems to related to the software. Though maybe I could use it as a slicer or designer.

New site to use from the video for models https://www.myminifactory.com/
