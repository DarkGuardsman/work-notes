## Idea for a design

The cube design I have been using has a lot of flaws. Its rather difficult to print, and a pain to put together. This is partially due to the holes that were added for bolts and the defects in it's 3D model. To work around this I should create my own designs. This will give me exposure to 3D design and let me toy with concepts.

My current idea is to design a print that is effectively a 1x1 stud with some length. Then work from this to create joints to effectively create a modular building system. I likely could find one if I look hard enough online. However, this will be good as I can customize for my use cases.

## Design

I ended up going with a 200mm long, 20mm high, and 20mm width stude. Each side has a 10mm by 10mm hole in each end. This would be simple enough to print and if it fails printing it will be easy enough to fix with post processing.

I used https://www.tinkercad.com/ for the design. To create the holes it required inserting empty cubes in each end. I think this is how the software is design to do cut outs. In blender there is a process for this as well but it merges down into vertex data.

## 3D printing design

Decided to design my own 3D print yesterday. Gave it a few tries printing. The results were good for 200mm length. The first print I stopped half way to check how it was printing. It looked good so I stopped it and went to sleep. As I was unsure if the print would finish fully due to lack of supports in the square holes in either side.
