## Previous two days notes

Notes for the previous two days were created today from memory. So information may not be 100% but it likely never would have been even if fresh... mind is strange :P 

## Cleaned up google drive

Going to split BBM from BBS stuff. This way I avoid modding overlapping with software & game development. 

Also going to remove access to library folder as I don't think it is smart sharing PDFs.

Creates some new folders for notes, yes these notes, and other things. Move a lot of stuff around to reduce access and cleared a lot of users off the folders.

## Google Lighthouse

Someone was talking about google light house. Seems there is a way to automate it with node.js to add to a pipeline. I will need to review this to see if I want to include it in my personal and work projects.

## Google API

Had an idea, again, to work on seeing if I can use google sheets as a mini-db for user based information. Since I want to make an inventory and personal health app this might work.

## Storage

I still need to keep thinking of storage options for the workshop. 3D printing is likely the solution but this place is a mess. I moved some more stuff into those cheap zip-lock boxes. All 4 of those boxes are damaged in some way and I should make a note to not buy more. The $8 large ones I got from walmart seem to be holding up extremely well for the cost. However, these $11 ones that are a 1/3rd or small in size are trash. The plastic is glass like and cracks easily when stressed. Which doesn't make for idea storage since dropping containers is a thing. Rather not drop a box of tools and have it got all over the room due to a broken side wall.

As for storage itself I need shelves for boxes, hangers for common items, and racks for tools. I already started printing the last item but still need to toy with it as a concept. The modular design of the files I download is interesting. However, it mimics common market items too strongly and didn't think through the process of storing tools. Most of the printed cross holes can't be used once tools are added. With how i'm using them I only can fight a handful of tools per plate printed. Meaning I'm wasting a lot of plastic when compared to just printing a single line of holes.

## Neat visualization

"voronoi tessellation as generated by fortune's algorithm"

She always seems to have these cool visualizations and this seems to be a continuation of one posted earlier. I should ook into it as it could make for an amazing land control generator. In which randomly generated dots are placed for citities/towns. Then land controlled by each town is setup using this method.

## Neat mod

Someone shared this after looking for a mod to change the overworld skybox

## Non-shit updater tools

Jas recommended this saying it does a great job and doesn't include bloat

Jas also notes 'Spybot search and destroy' seems to be working well. Can install it through the above app easily.

## Found old mods

I've likely had these in storage for ages and kept forgetting they existed. Likely fearing that exposing them would destroy me. Either way I uploaded a few to github and will upload the remaining later.

## Idea for later

Robot Waiters... likely could build a game, sim, or mod with this idea. They are really simple food drones that run on a track to each table. Look very basic being mostly casters with 2 driving wheels between the 4 casters. Each carries a single plate and seems to have a queue system for picking up food. I would love to make something like this for a game in unity just for fun. No real purpose, just make a pathing AI to repeat the actions.

## Random game cut scene idea

Show a pot being made at the start of the game. Then destroyed at the end of the game... only to be shown rebuilt in the next game with the cracks refilled with gold.

Build it -> Break it -> Reanimate it
