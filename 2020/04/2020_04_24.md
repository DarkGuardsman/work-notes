## Plan

Got nothing for today, going to take it easy and focus on day job

## Future

Need to orginize more, Think i'm going to take time to figure out all mods I have and what it takes to update.

## Youtube timestamps

Noticed this video had sections broken out with annotations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b21e7koGHGM turns out you can place timestamps in the description.

## What is the cost

Wasn't sure if I should have this in work notes or life notes. Its better in work notes as it could be used for teaching/learning.

Interesting idea brough up in this video. "What is the price", most of the video is not that useful. Its a lot of stuff brought up that is kinda right but not really. Lot of it comes down to personal preference... but this question is interesting. I've hit up on this myself a lot with 'risk vs reward' everything has a cost. In the case of something other than trade it is risk. What is the risk applied to myself when I do the action compared to the reward I gain. This is not always money based. For example if I want to push a release out sooner I might pay the cost of less sleep. However, if I decided its not worth it I can play video games and take the hit/cost of not getting anything productive done.

That said the video just went into using it as a case against the virus... the questions they ask are ones that should be asked. However, its rather biased in point of view. Personally I have yet to figure out if the lockdown was worth it or not. On one hand people could die and on the other we could destroy our way of living. Right now we see a lot of the damage being done by just being locked down for 2 months.

## Pick and place machine

Would be interesting to get one of these for building electronics. Combine with an etching machine and I could custom build a lot of parts.

Looks heavily 3D printed and interesting

## Printed 1am 25th

Yes next day, but started on this yesterday and took a few tries. Turns out the amazon filment prints ok at 200c with minor settings being adjusted. Compared to hatchbox which does better at 190c. Need to do more testing later to see how these settings matter.

Quality came out ok after several failures to either stick to the plate or string.No warping detected but the part is super flexible for what I normally print.
