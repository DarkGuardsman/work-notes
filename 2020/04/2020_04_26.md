## Current Thoughts

00:04am - not a lot of thoughts right now. Continueing log mostly from yesterday while i'm still awake. Likely will need to update this more as I got. What I can say is I want to keep focusing on cleaning and sotrage once I get up. Though I made good progress on 3D printing and research into ATX designs for jas. I didn't manage to work on mod audits but this was second priority. As I didn't finish cleaning either and likely need to rerun laundry as I forgot again while playing arma 3 all night XD

## Back filled images

1am - Spent an hour filling in images from dropbox into notes. I need to make sure I'm doing this as I'm taking notes to avoid having to recall what goes to which section. I also noticed I have a lot of images in camera folder and screenshots for the past. What I could do is fill in some pages in the past with the images and remarks about what I might have done that day.

## Current Project

1:40am - Nothing planned for today, likely will sleep til 2pm after staying awake until 2am

2am - After adding a ton of photos to fill in backlog of notes I think I need to write an app to remove spaces from images and resize to 40% for me. As I can't use spaces when doing images and do not want to sync 2MB plus photos to github.

![photo backlog](images/2020_04_26_photo_backlog.png)

I also noticed I have a ton of images till in 'my pictures' to go through to see if I want to log notes for them. Tons of 3D prints and other things I've done in this month alone.

## Something about buffered WiFi


> Jas at 1:52am: Apparently bridged wifi to ethernet now works on the Pi, so I may finally be able to replace the propriatary Wifi AP's we have with fully custom.

## Quick design

Quickly tried to design on an ITX part from the design I noted yesterday

![quick design of ITX](images/2020_04_26_2.20.00.png)

Going to search https://www.yeggi.com/ for pre-made ones

https://www.yeggi.com/q/itx/

Didn't find anything useful and jas noted she didn't need the hole in the middle

## 1U things

https://www.amazon.com/s?k=iStarUSA+D+Value+D-118V2-ITX

Jas linked me this on about something about getting the 'D-118V2-ITX without the FP drivebay' not entirely sure what the context is since i'm half asleep as this point.

Turns out they are ITX motherboard cases

## ITX case design 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4262498

Found this neat little case, might be useful for parts or maybe actually making it as a home mini-server

## Jas part request

Asked what I was making based on previous days

> Jas 2:53am: FlexATX blanking plate, ATX blanking plate, and a normal (Non holey) expansion bracket plate.

FlexATX is the black and blue drawing from yesterday

ATX blanks are the 5 I already printed

expansion bracket is the little flexable computer part I already printed. Given she wants either blank or holes pre-added for the following part

Didn't take long to find

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3977474

https://www.yeggi.com/q/pc+case+cover+plate/ Changing filter

Couldn't find one that was modular or includes lots, going to sleep instead of keeping at it as its 3:26am

## Start of day 3pm XD

Useful code examples to use for 1.15.2 update when I eventually do it

## Chunk cache

Talked to clienthax about chunk caches, I should use these in ICBM

https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/pull/5692


## Power failure

5:00pm power failed, was out rougly 5 to 10 mins. Nothing seems to be damaged that is critical. Printers seem to still work but one of the PIs is not turning on. As well some bulbs blew out from the surge but were easy to replace.

## E-stop plugin

https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/emergencystopsimplified/?utm_medium=announcements&utm_source=octoprint&utm_content=1.4.0

Might want to read into this as a way to add safty to my printers.

Reading over the page, it seems to be a button you physically add to the printer to act as an E-stop. Was thinking it might be a sensor suit that I could add to automate some of the issues. Given it could still be useful but in those cases I might write some firmware for the printer itself. This way it stops right away and goes into cooling. Rather than what I've seen the printer do when I fire a stop command. In which it finishes it's queue then stops.

I really do need to find something to smartly watch the printer for failures. This way it can stop early without wasting time.

## Print run

Going to print off a few more plates and covers for jas

Finished app and installed to global by packing `npm pack` then doing `npm install -g pack.file`

Ran into issues with power shell and had to run via cmd. Seems power shell is admin locked to prevent running scripts but... cmd has no issue XD

Part quality is good, one of the corners warped while cooling. Likely can heat fix it.

![jas part v1 printed](images/2020_04_26_21.33.56.jpg)

Can see in the top right the corner that warps. The back surface shows some signs of printing issues

![part issues jas v1 printed](images/2020_04_26_21.37.09.jpg)

Can see in the image the top left (same corner as earlier) has some mess going on with the lines. This can also be seen in the corner near the center hole. It might be a sign the first layer is not going down well.

Applying heat worked and I got the corner flat though its easy to tell I used heat to fix it. With a lighter I need to remember the heat is fast and can over melt the part. I think  heat gun or blow drier will work better.

Thinking about this I could make a little iron design to heat up to just under the melting point of PLA. This would let me smooth out flat parts to have a nicer texture.

## Packed up the parts

Partially packaged the parts while I wait

![package for jas](images/2020_04_26_22.00.23.jpg)

Making a good effort to recycle amazon waste package. The box is from some earlier amazon item I got. The bubble wrap is an amazon envolope, and the padding is some foam from electronics. Its likely overkill but should prevent damage to the plastic when thrown around.

Likey going ot use this to ship the package

## Looking for cable management

https://www.yeggi.com/q/cable+management/

----

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3208555

This one looks neat and simple, will print a few to see how they act.

----

https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/ethernet-cable-runners https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1320948

Simple network cable runner, doubt I need it or can use it properly. Though it has a few types so will download for later. 

Made an account on https://cults3d.com/ with username DarkCow before realizing the same part is on thingiverse

----

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4094066

This might be useful, its a nice tray and looks modular

----

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433356

Another neat design, looks like it requires mounting but could easily be double sided with tape

Which reminds me of a trick I saw. You can make double sided tape with painters tape and super glue. Place painters tape on both surfaces and then super glue. Recall it from a video on using a 3D printed vice. In which the author of the video used super glue to attach the vice to the table using this trick.

Cute little cable clips

![joint picture](images/2020_04_26_modular_hollow_universal_joint.png)

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26125

Feel like I've tried these before and had a lot of problems with joining the parts. As it required glueing the two halves together. Which turned out to be a pain for something that didn't work well. That said this design looks just a little different. So I might give it a try to see what happenes.

Lighting different on these pictures is massive. The first was taken on the printer under a LED bar and the second at my desk. Both locations are in the same room only a few feet apart.

Add notes about this 6/27/2020 8:27am

Part failed near the end of the print, not sure what happened and will need to review the timelaps. Found it fallen over in the morning as I was checking the print. 

![graugger progress](images/2020_04_27_00.39.53.jpg)

Sometime in the evening it was looking fine

![graugger progress failed view 1](images/2020_04_27_07.35.54.jpg)

![graugger progress failed view 2](images/2020_04_27_07.36.01.jpg)

Can see from the images it looks like it failed at the pin joint. Might have no longer been able to place layers properly or fell over at this point.

Looks like the timelaps video didn't record. So my best guess is the part fell over near the end. As the joints don't look like there was any critical failure. Though it is possible the head hit the part while moving.

Part quality failed for the most part. Looks like the one side came away from the board and caused additional layers to fail.

![s clip view 1](images/2020_04_26_23.02.59.jpg)

![s clip view 2](images/2020_04_26_23.03.05.jpg)

Can see in the above images that 1 side printed almost perfect. Meaning it is not the printer as a whole or the PLA that is the problem as a whole. Instead is seems like a minor failure stackup up to make a major failure.
