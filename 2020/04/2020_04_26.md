## Current Thoughts

00:04am - not a lot of thoughts right now. Continueing log mostly from yesterday while i'm still awake. Likely will need to update this more as I got. What I can say is I want to keep focusing on cleaning and sotrage once I get up. Though I made good progress on 3D printing and research into ATX designs for jas. I didn't manage to work on mod audits but this was second priority. As I didn't finish cleaning either and likely need to rerun laundry as I forgot again while playing arma 3 all night XD

## Back filled images

1am - Spent an hour filling in images from dropbox into notes. I need to make sure I'm doing this as I'm taking notes to avoid having to recall what goes to which section. I also noticed I have a lot of images in camera folder and screenshots for the past. What I could do is fill in some pages in the past with the images and remarks about what I might have done that day.

## Current Project

1:40am - Nothing planned for today, likely will sleep til 2pm after staying awake until 2am

2am - After adding a ton of photos to fill in backlog of notes I think I need to write an app to remove spaces from images and resize to 40% for me. As I can't use spaces when doing images and do not want to sync 2MB plus photos to github.

I also noticed I have a ton of images till in 'my pictures' to go through to see if I want to log notes for them. Tons of 3D prints and other things I've done in this month alone.

## Something about buffered WiFi


> Jas at 1:52am: Apparently bridged wifi to ethernet now works on the Pi, so I may finally be able to replace the propriatary Wifi AP's we have with fully custom.

## Quick design

Quickly tried to design on an ITX part from the design I noted yesterday

![quick design of ITX](images/2020_04_26_2.20.00.png)

Going to search https://www.yeggi.com/ for pre-made ones

https://www.yeggi.com/q/itx/

Didn't find anything useful and jas noted she didn't need the hole in the middle

## 1U things

https://www.amazon.com/s?k=iStarUSA+D+Value+D-118V2-ITX

Jas linked me this on about something about getting the 'D-118V2-ITX without the FP drivebay' not entirely sure what the context is since i'm half asleep as this point.

Turns out they are ITX motherboard cases

## ITX case design 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4262498

Found this neat little case, might be useful for parts or maybe actually making it as a home mini-server

## Jas part request

Asked what I was making based on previous days

> Jas 2:53am: FlexATX blanking plate, ATX blanking plate, and a normal (Non holey) expansion bracket plate.

FlexATX is the black and blue drawing from yesterday

ATX blanks are the 5 I already printed

expansion bracket is the little flexable computer part I already printed. Given she wants either blank or holes pre-added for the following part

Didn't take long to find

Couldn't find one that was modular or includes lots, going to sleep instead of keeping at it as its 3:26am
