## Water cooling 3D printer

Something that might be neat is to water cool the print head of my 3D printer. This will remove vibration from the print head and might control the tempature a little better. Could even use this system for other areas that need cooled. Such as the stepper motors which very much get rather hot. As well the logic system that currently has some rather loud fans.

Only problem with this is we need a cooling fan for the part itself. I could switch this over to an air blower rather than fan. This would again remove vibration on the print head itself.

Another bonus of this is I would remove some weight from the head and maybe make it easier to move.

## Pneumatic printer

An idea I've had before is to switch from stepper motors to pneumatic systems. This would give a lot of control and power for the system. One concern is to figure out how to measure distance of movement. Its one thing to push a part around but another to make sure its exact. Will have to do research as it very likely is possible to manage. After all factories use these systems to automate a ton of machines.

## Pneumatic direct drive

Could also use pneumatic systems to directly drive filment into the print head. As one complication with direct drive systems is weight of parts. If I don't need a heavy motor I could get away with a lighter system.

## 3D printer vibrations

This large printer vibrates a lot, trying to code on my work macbook and I can feel the violent movements of the machine. I think I need to place it on a surface that is more solid and add some type of shock system.

Another idea to go with this is to build a sensor to monitor the vibrations. This way I can optimize the machine to produce less violent movements and cut down on print defects as a result. Since this vibration has to be impacting the parts.

Failed 3 times

----

First failure I stopped as it was starting to come away from the board on each pass

Second one wrapped around the head when I wasn't paying attention

----

Third one came away and wrapped around the head after a few years

![third failure](images/2020_04_28_10.51.03.jpg)

small cloth fragments are from the thing I used to clean the printer with. As the plastic had jammed into the head rather badly.

----

Between each try I claned the board and the last one I sanded it slightly to remove plastic build up on the surface. I think there is a problem with the part that makes it easy to come away from the board. It might be the curved sides.

Going to try the large and small clips without ears from this

### First print failed

Looks like the first layer failed to bound to the bed. I likely need to relevel the bed and check for issues.

## Cool rendering

Same person as last time https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1255193781739180032

She always seems to be doing neat things with unity engine

## Neat air ships

I should make a game featuring air ships some day. As I love how they visually look but still act much like naval ships. You get a fantasy like vibe but can reuse a lot of elements of naval story telling.

Not the entire picture but a section taken to show the cool airships. The entire image is amazing

Including the whole image as its amazing. The airships look wonderful but so does the landscape. It also tells this little story of a world where people might sitll walk but also may have discovered airships for moving cargo.

The artist has a lot of other cool images on his twitter. https://twitter.com/Justinoaksford

## Scale++

Got my scale in the mail, amazon dropped it off at the mail box instead of my door.... no clue why.

Problem is it turns out the scale can't do light items. Even 1 pound items fail to set off the scale without help. I ordered two new scales that both note they can do .1 oz and the other .01 grams. Either of the two should work and both will be here tomorrow.
